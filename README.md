## Overview 

Did you know that by 2024 the mobile gaming market is projected to reach a staggering 120 billion dollars, surpassing the film and music industries combined? We believe the next one million users of Solana will come through gaming. That's why we've created Little Bonkers.

Little Bonkers is a beat 'em up style game inspired by arcade classics like Golden Axe and Captain Commando. In it, players explore the Solana ecosystem and its different communities through storytelling. After a short tutorial where the player is shown the controls and other basics, the game begins with Peeblo, a sets of correct fame arriving badly wounded and asking the Little Bonkers to deliver a desperately needed bottle of milk. The player is then thrust into a spooky forest where they are attacked by vicious zombie and skeletal OK bears.

## Mobile First Approach
We believe a mobile-first approach is key for adoption and to quickly grow the player base. In order to play, users need only to open their wallet browsers and begin playing right in their wallets. This makes it easy to send rewards and get analytics from the players. As the player advances, defeated enemies allow the player to earn Bonk and any other Solana program library tokens such as Dust and USDC. We chose to use Bonk as our main reward token as it's easily transportable to other platforms and there is a large supply of it available.

## Solana Community References
Throughout the game, we see references to important players of the Solana community. For example, a Lieutenant Lollipop encourages you to continue every time you defeat all the enemies and can move forward. Skilled users will be able to progress to the end of the level where they meet the game's first boss, none other than King Fudd from Twitter fame. If the boss is beaten, the player is greeted by a Sprite of Solana's Raj Gokal, who then takes the player for a wild bull ride.

## Reward System

When the mission is completed, the player is rewarded with a whitelist token along with the Bonk and other SPL tokens that they've collected throughout the level. Currently, over 100 players have earned their tokens with only about a quarter of them listing for sale. Using Hello Moon's powerful analytics SDK, we can track how many tokens the game has issued. The kind folks over at Hello Moon even built an endpoint specifically for this competition so we would be able to check what other collections and communities overlap with our own tokens. Having detailed knowledge as to who has what tokens and why allows us to tell intricate stories that weave reality with the game's lore.

## Factions and Gemstones

Within the game, there are four competing factions, four schools of magic, each embodied by a mesmerizing gemstone. Using on-chain analytics, many game mechanics can be devised that will allow us to leverage the social interactions between these four different communities and others from outside the game to maximize engagement. This enables us to create an engaging decentralized social game find platform where users can explore web3 and the broader Solana community. By doing so, we aim to increase the number of daily active recurring users on the platform.

## Proof of Play
Since we need to constantly be refilling our game's wallet with Bonks for players to continue earning, we needed a sustainable way of achieving this. That's why we've come up with Proof of Play. Proof of play just means that we are tokenizing validator nodes that are processing the blockchain transactions and restricting playing to holders.
